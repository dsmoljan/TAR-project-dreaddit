Well, yesterday she asked if I wanted to go to the beach next weekend, I said yes, and then today I told her I couldn't because I was supposed to watch my sister's kids. She wants to know why I don't take them with us. It's a two hour drive, and I really just don't want to go. But then she says that I always say no when she asks me to go somewhere with her.      0\n",

      "112  Spring 2102 I began to see a man that I worked with and that only made my roommate jealous and angry. I went to a pdoc (who was basically a pharmaceutical dispensary and appointments only lasted 15 minutes) who diagnosed me with ADHD, generalized anxiety disorder and caffeine dependency. My ex-roommate(who had PTSD from fighting in Iraq and BPD) became jealous that I was hanging out with and spending all my time with a man that was not him, he began to hide my prescription anxiety and sleep medication so I would have to spend more time at my apartment and with him. Late summer 2012 I was able to catch him doing a series of illegal things, had him arrested for petty theft and evicted him from the apartment. I spent a couple months more in the apartment and ultimately ended up moving in with the man I had begun to see (he and I have now been together almost 5 years).      0\n",

      "124  I'd never heard this idea until recently, and I'm starting to see it cropping up more, always in opposition to any kind of support (or even empathy) for the homeless - any attempt to help the homeless is pointless because 'most' homeless people want to be homeless; therefore housing programs/assistance, mental health & substance abuse support are wasted because the homeless are too lazy to get themselves out of homelessness and 'enjoy' their condition, because they don't have to work, because they don't have to pay bills, because they don't have responsibilities, because they're lazy etc. I strenuously disagree with this, and I feel like it's an attempt to move the goalposts; there's a growing awareness that homeless people may not necessarily be homeless because they got themselves into that position and they 'deserve' it, but because of substance abuse issues and mental health problems, coupled with a breakdown in social network. But that's a lie, or 'lefty propaganda', for some people; they want to believe, despite whatever legitimate reasons some homeless may have for not being in shelters, say, that it's a *moral failing* \\- going full circle, they don't deserve help because their homelessness is a consequence of decisions they made.

I tend to express myself intensely to people without realizing it, giving the wrong impression because it's natural for me to be intense, but I am also quite composed and can for the most part be 'chill' but it's just that I only have two parts to me, a 'chill' way of expressing myself, and a passionate/intense way of expressing myself, so I come off the wrong way without realizing it when I think I'm being normal.

      "166  Hi PTSD forums, Selective mutism has been something i have been afflicted with for 7 years since middle school. It was only in senior year of high school that I began speaking again thanks to the help of a few friends whom i no longer am in contact with and also my football coach/teacher. Now in college however I dread presentations. Often, I would lock down and say one or two sentences and after that say \"i'm done, ill hand it off to my group member\" or I would splurge out incoherent sentences that have no purpose or thought behind them during presentations and people would have a confused look on their faces.      0\n",

Unfortunately I’ve been without a steady job for 6 months so I can’t do to much, but I was thinking about buying a bunch of plastic water bottles, freezing them, and carrying them in a cooler in my car to give out when I’m at lights. Would this be helpful? What other small or inexpensive things would help make the summer a bit more bearable?      1\n",

My mom however cares for my gf, buys her presents, keeps in mind her allergies and cooks her food that she'd eat, so I don't get why my gf would have an issue)  - Apparently it's weird that I spend all my time and don't like to hang out with friends      0\n",

I'm sure the majority of my abusers knew I was underage, how could they not? I told some of them how old I was, and most of the ones I told were okay with me being underage, although were extremely coercive, threatening, and frightening at times. I was constantly gaslight, verbally abused, and made to feel frightened and ashamed by many of these people, but I felt like I had to keep trying, like I had to be there to perform for them. All of the physical abuse (sexual and otherwise) that I've survived, happened after I turned 18, starting with my first REAL girlfriend, and the relationships that immediately proceeded her.      0\n",
